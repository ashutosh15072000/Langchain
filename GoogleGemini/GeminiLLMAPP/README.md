## Overview

This code is a Streamlit application that uses the Gemini LLM (Large Language Model) from Google's Generative AI to answer user-input questions.

## Breakdown

**Importing Libraries and Loading Environment Variables**

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries:

- `dotenv` to load environment variables from a .env file
-`os` to interact with the operating system
- `streamlit (alias st)` to create a web application
- `google.generativeai (alias genai)` to interact with Google's Generative AI models
- The `load_dotenv()` function is called to load environment variables from a `.env` file. The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` variable is retrieved from the environment variables using `os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY").`

## Configuring the Generative AI Model

The `genai.configure()` function is called with the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to configure the Generative AI model.

**Defining the get_gemini_response() Function**

The `get_gemini_response()` function takes a question as input and returns the response from the Gemini LLM model. Here's what the function does:

- Creates a `GenerativeModel` instance with the model name "gemini-pro".
- Calls the `generate_content()` method on the model, passing the question as input.
- Returns the `text` attribute of the response.

## Creating the Streamlit Application

The code creates a Streamlit application with the following components:

- `st.set_page_config()` sets the page title to "Q&A Demo".
- `st.header()` displays a header with the text "Gemini LLM Application".
- `st.text_input()` creates a text input field with the label "Input" and a key of "input".
- `st.button()` creates a button with the label "Ask the question".

## Handling User Input

When the user clicks the "Ask the question" button, the code inside the `if submit`: block is executed. Here's what happens:

- The `get_gemini_response()` function is called with the `user-input question`.
- The response from the Gemini LLM model is stored in the `response `variable.
- The response is displayed on the page using `st.write() `with the label "Gemini's Response:".
